This is the repo to provide supplementary material for the repoducability of the fuzzy-BDI approach.




# Technical Notes #
As indicated during our development, there were certain challenges encountered during the implementation of the production line system. These challenges are worth mentioning as they provide insights into the practical aspects and considerations of our study. Since the system was constructed using Jason, JADE, and BrickPI API (Java), managing all these technologies was burdensome. At first, Jason's agent-programming environment is set to \emph{JADE} environment mode. Because Jason benefits from \emph{JADE} infrastructure to create a distributed topology for communication, to activate distributed agent topology, this option should be given in \emph{.masj} file. Then, \emph{infrastructure: Jade(main\_container\_host("IP address"))} parameter should be given to state that the target IP address has the main container. After that, the other \emph{JADE} containers can register themselves to the main container via this target IP address. We also experienced that versions after \emph{Eclipse 2020-03} have a bug, and \emph{build.xml} file cannot be generated by these later versions. Therefore, we switched back to the 2020-03 version. After that, we encounter \emph{Java.swingx} errors generated by BrickPI. We recognized that BrickPI does not support any graphical-based Java implementation. Therefore, we switched Jason to the console mode using \emph{handlers= java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler}. However, there was another bug: the build.xml file does not include \emph{logging.properties} file. Therefore, we added \emph{include name= "logging.properties"} parameter after the \emph{include name="**/*.mas2j" } parameter. When we switched to \emph{JADE} infrastructure mode, we re-encountered with java.swingx problem. Therefore, inside the  \emph{build.xml} file, we deleted the \emph{-gui} parameter. We then sent the project files to RaspberryPI 3. We installed the Ant compiler and used \emph{ant -f projectName.xml Main-Container} to run our application. To run the other containers, their names should be used as \emph{projectName.xml "other container name"}. We hope the technical problems we have encountered during the implementation and provided solutions can help the  researchers, developers and practitioners.
